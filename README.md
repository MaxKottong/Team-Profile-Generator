# Team Profile Generator

As a team lead, I would like to be able to showcase my team and their individual skills to clients. This app will ask a series of questions on building a roster
and when done will automatically create an HTML file containing all of the information.

## Dependencies
* Inquirer - `npm install inquirer@8.2.4`

## Usage
`npm index.js`
